🎥 Video Types (Beyond Talking Head)

These will give your feed variety, keep viewers engaged, and make your message hit harder.

B-Roll Storyteller

Overlay visuals of you working, writing, coaching, traveling, or with your planner while your voice narrates.

Great for tips, motivation, or storytelling posts.

Micro-Documentary

Mix interviews (of you or others), B-roll, and ambient sound.

Ideal for “behind the brand” or “what I’ve learned as a coach” pieces.

Day-in-the-Life / Workflow

Real moments—morning routine, content setup, client calls, journaling.

Perfect for authenticity and relatability.

Tutorial / Demo

Show your planner in action, a journaling method, or productivity technique.

Mix over-the-shoulder + close-ups.

Voiceover Reel

No talking head at all — just clips + music + your narration.

Powerful for motivational or emotional posts.

Reaction / Duet

React to a trending clip, quote, or topic.

Quick engagement boost; lets you show personality.

Text-Only with Motion

On-screen text with music, ambient video, or minimalist motion graphics.

Clean way to drop quotes or “1-minute takeaways.”

Cinematic Sequence

Use slow motion, lens flares, or natural light transitions to set a mood.

Great for branding intros, promo reels, or seasonal posts.

🎬 Shot Types (To Mix & Match)

Think of these as your visual vocabulary.

1. Wide Shot (Establishing)

Sets the scene — office, coffee shop, street.

Good for opening context or transitions.

2. Medium Shot

Waist-up, your go-to for natural conversation or gestures.

3. Close-Up

Focus on expressions or objects — writing in planner, flipping a page, sipping coffee.

Adds intimacy and detail.

4. Over-the-Shoulder (OTS)

Great for tutorials, journaling, or showing a client call setup.

Puts the audience in your POV.

5. POV (Point-of-View)

Your hands typing, holding your phone, walking.

Immersive and personal.

6. Cutaway / Insert Shot

B-roll that matches your script — e.g., “I had to pause and reset” → show you exhaling or closing a notebook.

7. Tracking / Movement Shot

You walking through a hallway or into a room.

Adds life, direction, and momentum.

8. Low Angle / High Angle

Low = power and confidence.

High = vulnerability or reflection.

9. Detail / Macro

Pen tip, hand on planner, morning coffee pour.

Great for texture and rhythm in editing.
